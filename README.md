# volleyball_tracker

This project is realised for the course of ML4CV at UniBo. The aim is to build an AI system able to track the volleyball players inside videos; the videos are in reference of my volleyball team and the camera is always in the same spot, behind the players and the system will track the players in the close half of the field.
